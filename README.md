Ace

Originally intended to be an engine for creating \href{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_Attorney}{Ace Attorney} cases in Python. Unfortunately for me, this has \href{http://pywright.dawnsoft.org/wordpress/}{already been done}. So, the project will not likely not progress too much farther than it currently has.

As is, it's a good base for scrolling text and syncing that scrolling text with a character's mouth movements. If I flesh it out a bit more, it could be used for future games.

Running the Demo
----
Make sure that Python 2.7 is installed, along with the PyGame module. Then, run text.py.
